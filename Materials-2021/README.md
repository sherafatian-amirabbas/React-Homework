## Concepts and techniques
The course will concentrate on declarative programming and extensive testing.

### View layer
[ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) is used to create view components.

## End result
At the end of the course, students should feel comfortable about working with
JavaScript front-end projects in teams of any size. Students are able to build
and test a medium-sized JavaScript application on their own.
