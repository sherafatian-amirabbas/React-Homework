# Exam 2021

As in-person exams cannot be conducted this year, the exam will take place as a
"Zoom exam" in which you must participate remotely.

# Prerequisites

* Have an application scaffold ready based on lecture 7 or homework 7 solution.
* Delete all components, reducers etc. You will not need them and unused files
  will cause deductions from your final score.
* Have all the dependencies installed to save time during the exam.
* Ensure the application starts with `yarn start`.

# The exam

* You'll join the same Zoom meeting as in the lecture @ 16:15
* ./ticket-to-student.md will be updated and you can check, based on your
  matriculation nr, what ticket you must solve. Completing the wrong ticket
  nets you 0 points.
* During the exam you can use lecture materials and any online resources, but
  copying code is strictly prohibited. All messaging/email applications must be
  terminated and remain closed for the duration of the exam. Any infractions
  will be dealt with in the same manner as cheating in an in-person exam.
* Before the exam starts, each student will be moved to a separate breakout
  room where they must immediately start sharing their screen and turn on
  video. 
* I will push updates to both ./ticket-A.md and ./ticket-B.md containing
  requirements for the application which you must implement.
* From this moment, you will have 2 hours to complete the exam. Upload the
  solution in the same manner as with homework to
