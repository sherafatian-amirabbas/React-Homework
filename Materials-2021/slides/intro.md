# About the course

* Student feedback says that the course is difficult
* Extensive **individual** programming homework
* Listeners are welcome, but their homework will not be reviewed

You will need to write at least 1000 lines of code, **by yourself** to complete
homework. If this is not what you signed up for, there is still a option to
de-register.

# Course overview

* Working from principles over hacking things together
* A lot of (unit) testing which will be graded
* Functional programming
* Composition of simple ideas

???

Simple ideas can be composed to produce complex system if the means of
composition are powerful, simple and flexible.

---

# Course overview

* Discussed topics are not specific to the browser nor JavaScript
  * Many functional programming patterns are similar
* For better or for worse, the Web is the most popular and accessible platform
* This necessitates learning some JavaScript and the DOM (Document Object Model)

---

# Calendar

A lot of work!

* 3 EAP = 78 hours
* 1 homework ~every week

---

# Homework

* 7 homework, 10 points each
* Continuous software project
* First one given out today
* ~8 hours spent on each homework
* Hard deadline 23:59 the next Sunday (10 days)
  * Miss deadline = 10 points gone from final grade
* Catch-up application published Monday morning

???

The catch-up application is the only piece of code that can be used without
attribution. It is there to avoid people who fail to produce a good enough
solution one week from failing the whole course.

# Homework

* No hand holding!
* Slack workspace #help-homework for support
  * There is one of me, please help each other as well
* A lot of reading and figuring things out from zero
* Straight to cold water!
* Practical project lead experience

---

## Tips

* Start early, homework simply cannot be accepted after deadline
* Code style matters!
  * This includes putting effort variable naming
* What cannot be understood, cannot be graded

---

# Homework

* I've been reading and reviewing code for a long time
* I will be reading and reviewing homework from each one of you
* It is easy for me to detect when code was pieced together from multiple sources
* I've had to deal with **plagiarism** **every year**
* If you plagiarize homework, you will get an F for the whole course and a note of plagiarism on your university record

I am here to teach as a guest lecturer and have zero patience for plagiarism.
There are easier ways to score 3 EAPs.

---

# Homework - what can I use?

* Code from previous years of this course - **NO**
* Code from other students - **NO**
* Code that you found anywhere from the internet - **NO**
  * Only okay if it is a small snippet and properly attributed
* Basing your homework on the last week's catch-up application - **YES**

---

# Exam

* 30 points, multiple choice
* Will be relatively simple if you attended all the lectures
* Exam result not required for final grade
* 51 points total = passed
