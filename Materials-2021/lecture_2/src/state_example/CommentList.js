  CommentList has been updated to receive `comments` as props.
  An instance of `Comment` component is created for each comment in `comments`
  array.
  When dealing with lists of elements, each unique element must have a special
  `key` property.
  This allows React to distinguish between elements that changed vs elements
  that were removed and replaced with a different element.
