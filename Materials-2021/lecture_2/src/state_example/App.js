  `App` component now has state: inserted comments.
  Initial comments state is set to empty array in constructor.

  In the constructor we also mimic receiving new components using
  `setInterval`, every 3 seconds 2 new components are 'received' and added to
  state.

  We pass down the state as props to `CommentList`. Whenever state changes,
  `App` and all its children are re-rendered.
