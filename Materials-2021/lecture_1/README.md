# Lecture 1

Lecture 1 gives an overview of JavaScript tools and ecosystem. It also
describes the standard way to build a modern JavaScript _browser application_.

## Study goals

There are a lot of concepts and tools described in lecture 1. This is to get a
flying start to be able to implement an interesting application with 7
homeworks.

It is not necessary to understand all lecture 1 concepts in depth immediately.
If something creates confusion later, lecture 1 can be revisited.
