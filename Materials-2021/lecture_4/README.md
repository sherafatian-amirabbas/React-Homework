# Lecture 4

Lecture 4 expands on state management techniques. State management in React
has been heavily influenced by the success of
[Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux), so much so that in latest versions
of React, some Redux patterns are incorporated into React hooks.

## Study goals

## What is a reducer

- What is state? What is a value?
- What are actions?
- What is the upside of collecting state into a larger object instead of having individual pieces of state?
- Why is reducer-based logic easy to test?

## Reducers with React

- How to incorporate a reducer into a React application?
- What are _selector_ and _action creator_ functions?
- How to test reducers?
